# Project Instructions - Introduction to DataCamp Projects - SQL

## Task 1: Instructions

This is a DataCamp project!
Projects allow you to practice and apply the skills you've learned in the DataCamp courses. In each project you carry out an end-to-end analysis, on a real-world task, using real-world tools and workflows. The exception is this project, which is just an introduction to the DataCamp project interface.

On the side, you have a Jupyter Notebook, a free, open source web application that is great for interactive data analysis. A DataCamp project consists of a number of tasks, and here, you have the task instructions. Your first task is easy:

Run the code cell below "1. This is a Jupyter Notebook!" by clicking the run cell button ( ▶| Run ) or hitting Ctrl + Enter. This will calculate how many children were born per day on average in 2016.
Then, click the Next Task button below.

## Task 2: Instructions

The Jupyter Notebook in a DataCamp project will contain an analysis, data exploration, or other narrative combining code, data, and text. But, and here is the catch, some of the code is missing, and it's up to you to get it right! Sometimes you will only need to fix small things with the code, but in some projects, you will get to write a whole analysis yourself.

However, in this project you won't have to do much — the notebook on the side is almost complete — there are just some minor issues that you need to deal with:

Replace the arguments to greet('Jane', 'Bond') with your name.
Run the code cell. (As this is part of every task we will drop this instruction from now on.)

## Task 3: Instructions

Run the code cell to connect to the countries database, then query and display the first three rows of it.

Then, click the Next Task button below.

## Task 4: Instructions

Select all of the columns from the countries table where the name of the country is 'Belgium'. Remember to use single quotes (') for string constants like country names!
The list of instructions for this task are now listed at the top — that's where you'll usually find them in DataCamp projects. Below the list of instructions (that is, right here) you will find more information that will help you solve the task. For example:

A triple dot ... in a code cell means that something is missing and has to be filled in. This task requires you to fill in a SQL query.

If you still feel at a loss as for what to do you can always click the hint below.

## Task 5: Instructions

Use DataFrame() method the result object (which is called a ResultSet) to convert the results to a pandas DataFrame.
Helpful links are often provided in projects below the horizontal line that follows the task's bullet points.

## Task 6: Instructions

Run the code cell to query and display the columns of the countries table.

Then, click the Next Task button below.

## Task 7: Instructions

Run the code cell to plot the number of countries in each continent as a bar chart.

Then, click the Next Task button below.

## Task 8: Instructions

And this was just a short introduction to DataCamp projects. We hope you enjoyed it too! You are now ready to get started on your first real DataCamp project.
