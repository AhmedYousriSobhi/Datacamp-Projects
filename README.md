## Project - Introduction to DataCamp Projects

__Project Description__

This is an introduction to DataCamp projects. DataCamp projects allow you to apply the skills you have learned in DataCamp courses. In each project, you will carry out an end-to-end analysis on real-world tasks using real-world tools and workflows.

In doing so, you will learn how to work with Jupyter notebooks: an open-source web application that is great for interactive data analysis.

## Project - A New Era of Data Analysis in Baseball

__Project Description__

There's a new era of data analysis in baseball. Using a new technology called Statcast, Major League Baseball is now collecting the precise location and movements of its baseballs and players. In this project, you will use Statcast data to compare the home runs of two of baseball's brightest (and largest) stars, Aaron Judge (6'7") and Giancarlo Stanton (6'6"), both of whom now play for the New York Yankees.

The dataset used in this project is from [Baseball Savant](https://baseballsavant.mlb.com/about)
